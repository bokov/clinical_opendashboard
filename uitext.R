txtMainVarCommon <- "This plot allows you to see how prevalent various values of '%s' are for each cohort compared to the overall patient pool."
txtMainVarStatic <- "The left-most columns represent the total patients ever seen by the department. The other columns are cohorts within that patient pool."
txtMainVarDynamic <- "The y-axis represents the fraction of the total patients ever seen by the department who have at least one occurence of a particular code. The x-axis represents the same thing but as a fraction of the corresponding cohort within this patient pool. Points above/left of the diagonal line represent codes that are less common in their respective cohorts than in the overall patient pool, and points below/right are more common."
txtMainHelp <- "Please mouse-over the plot to see more information. Clicking the color on the legend will hide the cohort/population of that color from the plot. There are also some useful controls in the top right of the plot, including ones for zooming it and for downloading it as an image. Please note that patients can be in more than one of the cohorts, and can multiple different values recorded during different visits, so the columns are not mutually exclusive with each other. There are currently two different kinds of plots, and the one you are looking at was auto-selected based on the class of variable you chose."
